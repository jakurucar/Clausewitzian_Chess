# NOTES
Currently using MongoDB as the back-end datastore.

This installation is meant for local use only. This is NOT a secure installation or configuration.

# Install

## Ubuntu
`sudo apt install mongodb`

## Windows
[Windows Installer](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)

## Node
May need to rebuild application after installation of mongo.

`npm rebuild` or `npm install` (not sure which is correct)

NOTE: you may need to upgrade nodejs to 7.4 or higher.

## Create a Database and User
The user is currently hardcoded in the /database/mongo.js file. See the _user_ and _pass_ variables. In future this will be extracted to a configuration file.

To create a user, you need to access your Mongo installation's shell. In Ubuntu/Linux, simply run `mongo` in a terminal.

1. Execute `use dcchess;` to switch to the dcchess database. If it doesn't exist, it is created for you.
2. Add a user
  1. Execute the following to create the user: `db.createUser({user:"mongouser", pwd:"mongopass", roles: [{role: "readWrite", db: "dcchess"}]});`
  2. This should create the user 'mongouser' with read/write permission on the dcchess database. Execute `show users;` to see that your new user has been added."

# Configuration
Currently using MongoDB as is, so it's only allowing localhost connections. As mentioned above for user configuration, the connection information is currently hardcoded in /database/mongo.js as well.
